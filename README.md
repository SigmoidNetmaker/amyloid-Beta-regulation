# amyloid-Beta-regulation
Maude code for representing, simulating, and analyzing the molecular interactions that mediate the regulation of amyloid-Beta. This code was used in the analyses described in the following two jouirnal articles:  

Anastasio TJ (2011) Data-driven modeling of Alzheimer disease pathogenesis. Journal of theoretical biology. 290:60-72.  
Anastasio TJ (2013) Exploring the contribution of estrogen to amyloid-Beta regulation: a novel multifactorial computational modeling approach. Frontiers in pharmacology. 4:16.  

Maude is a delcarative programming language used for the specification, simulation, and analysis of complicated systems. For all things Maude visit: https://maude.cs.illinois.edu/w/index.php/The_Maude_System  

The following suit of Maude files explore most of the metabolic interactions that regulate amyloid-Beta, as identified before 2010.  

alzheimer -- this module specifies most of the metabolic interactions that regulate amyloid-Beta  
mc-alzheimer -- this module sets up model-checking of the alzheimer specification  
alzheimer-check -- this command initiates a model-check of the alzheimer specification  
alzheimer-rew -- this command initiates rewrites of the alzheimer specification  
alzheimer-search -- this command initiates a search in the module alzheimer specification
